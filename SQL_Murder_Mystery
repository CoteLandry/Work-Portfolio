-- Step 1: Run this query to find the names of the tables in this database

  SELECT name 
  FROM sqlite_master
  where type = 'table'

-- Step 2: Run this query to find the structure of the `crime_scene_report` table

  SELECT sql 
  FROM sqlite_master
  where name = 'crime_scene_report'

-- Step 3: Query table. Use select distincts to see what types exist in database.
  
select * from crime_scene_report
	where date = 20180115
	  and type = 'murder'
    and city = 'SQL City'

-- Step 4: Continue to learn more about the witnesses to this crime by searching people database
  
select * from person 
	where name like '%Annabel%' 
    and address_street_name like 'Franklin Ave'
	limit 10

select * from person 
  where address_street_name like 'Northwestern Dr'
order by address_number desc

-- Step 5: Look at interviews from witnesses to gain more context as to what happened! First, get sense of table structure

SELECT sql 
FROM sqlite_master
where name = 'interview'

-- Step 6: Look at interviews from witnesses to gain more context as to what happened!

select * from interview
where person_id = 16371

select * from interview
where person_id = 14887

-- Step 7: Okay clearly the killer is a gold member of this club, so let’s check the member list. First, get a sense of the structure of the table

SELECT sql 
FROM sqlite_master
where name = 'get_fit_now_member'

-- Step 8: Now let’s narrow down our suspect pool. There’s 2 viable people here! 

select * from get_fit_now_member
where id like '48Z%' 
and membership_status = 'gold'

-- Looks like they both went to the gym on this date. Annabel checked in at 16:00 and exited at 17:00
-- Both suspects were at the gym around this time, so they remain suspicious.

-- Step 8: One witness reported that they saw the person on Jan 9th. 
-- Let’s see who checked in on the 9th

select membership_id, check_in_time, check_out_time, name from get_fit_now_check_in as a 
	left join get_fit_now_member as b on a.membership_id = b.id
	where check_in_date = 20180109

-- Step 9: Check for car license plate. 
-- Note: Can remove any female suspects, as a man was clearly reported in this crime.

  select * from drivers_license as d
  left join person as p on d.id = p.license_id
		where d.plate_number like '%H42W%'
			and gender = 'male'
			and p.id in (28819, 67318)

-- Only one person remains after this search, identifying our killer as Jeremy Bowers!

-- Step 10: Insert into Solutions DB and check if correct answer

  INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
  
  SELECT value FROM solution;

-- Advanced Challenge: Find the person who hired Jeremy Bowers based on interview transcript info

select d.id, p.name, i.annual_income, p.ssn, f.* from drivers_license as d
left join person as p on p.license_id = d.id
left join income as i on i.ssn = p.ssn
left join facebook_event_checkin as f on f.person_id = p.id
where height >= 65 and height <= 67
and gender = 'female'
and hair_color = 'red'
and car_make like 'Tesla'
and car_model = 'Model S'
and f.event_name like '%SQL Symphony Concert%'
